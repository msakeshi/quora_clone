                        Winter session of Parliament Day 15 Live Updates: The week-long standoff in Parliament is likely to come to an end today with the Centre and Opposition gearing up for a special debate on the Constitution. The last few days have been washed out, first over the Congress’s insistence on a thorough discussion on the Adani row and then regarding the Centre hitting out at Grand Old Party over its alleged links with George Soros
                        The Constitution debate will be held in the Lok Sabha on Friday and Saturday, and in the Rajya Sabha on Monday and Tuesday.
                            Bills in Parliament today: The Bills for consideration and passing in Rajya Sabha include the Artificial Intelligence (Protection of Rights of Employees) Bill, 2023, the Deepfake Prevention and Criminalisation Bill, 2023, the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2024 (amendment of article 368), the Special Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2024.

                        The wedding season in the world of South Indian cinema continues to bring joy, with the latest celebrity to join the list being National Award-winning actress Keerthy Suresh, who tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend and entrepreneur Antony Thattil.
                        Sharing glimpses of their special day on social media, Keerthy posted the first pictures with the hashtag #ForTheLoveOfNyke, a heartfelt nod to their relationship and their beloved dog, Nyke.
                            The couple embraced their cultural roots by marrying in a traditional Tamil Brahmin Iyengar ceremony. Keerthy donned the elegant madisar, a nine-yard sari draped in the Iyengar kattu style, while Antony complemented her in a veshti.
